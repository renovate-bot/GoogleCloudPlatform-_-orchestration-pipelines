A library for defining and generating Apache Airflow DAGs declaratively using YAML. Currently focused on orchestration of GCP resources (Dataproc, BigQuery, Dataform) and DBT...

> [!NOTE]
> This library is currently in **Preview**.

## Overview

`orchestration-pipelines` allows you to define complex data workflows in simple, human-readable YAML files. It abstracts away the boilerplate of writing Airflow DAGs in Python, making it easier for non-Python experts to create and manage pipelines.

- **Documentation**: [docs/doc.md](docs/doc.md)
- **Changelog**: [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)

## Supported Python Versions

Python >= 3.9

## Features

-   **Declarative DAGs**: Define your pipeline structure, triggers, and actions in YAML.
-   **Rich Actions Support**: Built-in support for:
    -   Python Scripts
    -   Google Cloud BigQuery
    -   Google Cloud Dataproc (Serverless, Ephemeral and existing clusters)
    -   Google Cloud Dataform
    -   DBT
-   **Automatic Generation**: A simple Python call generates the full Airflow DAG.
-   **Versioning**: Supports versioning of pipelines via a manifest file(as of Preview, on Google Cloud Composer).

## Installation

You can install `orchestration-pipelines` from PyPI:

```bash
pip install orchestration-pipelines
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Ensure your `apache-airflow-client` version is fully compatible with Airflow 3 to prevent critical DAG parsing or runtime errors. This package utilizes Airflow Client API calls to interact with the metadata database; `apache-airflow-client` library introduces significant architectural shifts in newer versions, a version mismatch will likely break communication and disrupt your pipelines. Always verify that your client version aligns with your Airflow environment to ensure stability.

## Quick Start

### 1. Define your pipeline in YAML

Create a file named `my_pipeline.yml`:

```yaml
modelVersion: "1.0"
pipelineId: "my_pipeline"
description: "A simple example pipeline"
runner: "airflow"

defaults:
  projectId: "your-gcp-project"
  location: "us-central1"

triggers:
  - schedule:
      interval: "0 4 * * *"
      startTime: "2026-01-01T00:00:00"
      catchup: false

actions:
  - sql:
      name: "create_table"
      query:
        inline: "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `your-gcp-project.my_dataset.my_table` (id INT64, name STRING);"
      engine:
        bigquery:
          location: "US"
```

### 2. Generate the Airflow DAG

Create a Python file named `my_pipeline.py` in your Airflow DAGs folder:

```python
from orchestration_pipelines_lib.api import generate

# Generate Airflow DAG from pipeline definition file
# airflow | dag
# Root is "dags" directory in Composer bucket
generate("dataform-pipeline-local.yml")
```

Airflow will parse this Python file and automatically generate the DAG based on your YAML definition.

## Advanced Features

### Versioning and Manifests

You can manage multiple versions of your pipelines using a `manifest.yaml` file. This allows you to specify which version of a pipeline should be active.

See the `examples/` directory for a sample `manifest.yaml` and how to use it.
